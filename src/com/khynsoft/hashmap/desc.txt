[[HashMap]]
A HashMap is a map used to store mappings of key-value pairs.
HashMap in Java works on hashing principles.
It is a data structure which allows us to store object and retrieve it in constant time
O(1) provided we know the key.
In hashing, hash functions are used to link key and value in HashMap.
